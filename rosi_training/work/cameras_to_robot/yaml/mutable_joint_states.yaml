# This file defines the initial positions of the 'mutable joints' that
# were defined using the camera macro in the URDF. They are read on start
# up and written to when the mutable joint state publisher shuts down. 

# TODO: you will need to fill in all 6 six joints with the joint name
# as it appears in the URDF and an initial value. You may want to consult
# the camera macro in the industrial_extrinsic_cal package (/urdf) for the
# joint names
